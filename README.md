# **Kaggle Ranch**

## Overview
- Scrape trending datasets from Kaggle and quickly train models.

## Features

- Organizes datasets with their model performances.

- Compare performance on 27 models + a neural network.
    - Outputs model performance and processed data in CSV format for every dataset.

- Preprocessing

    - Detects continuous and categorical variables.

    - Normalizes and imputes data.


- Makes use of FastAI for preprocessing and uses TabNet as a baseline model.
